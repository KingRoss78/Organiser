    "description": "With a defined contribution pension (sometimes called money purchase) you build up a pot of money that you can use to provide an income in retirement. Unlike defined benefit schemes, which promise a specific income, the income you might get from a defined contribution scheme depends on factors including the amount you pay in, the fund investment performance and the choices you make at retirement."
