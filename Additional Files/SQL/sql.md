You can run various lines of code to isolate and filter out data from the students table. For example, `SELECT * FROM Students;` will show all entries in the table. In addition, `SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY Age DESC;` will show all students in descending order of age. If you wanted to show the average age of students, you can run `SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Students;`.
